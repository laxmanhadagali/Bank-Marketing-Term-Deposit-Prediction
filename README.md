# Bank Marketing Analytics – Term Deposit Subscription Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank marketing campaign data and
building a predictive machine learning model to identify customers
who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit.

The goal is to help bank marketing teams make data-driven decisions,
optimize campaign strategies, and improve conversion rates.

---

##  Objectives
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand customer behavior
- Identify key factors influencing term deposit subscriptions
- Build and evaluate predictive machine learning models
- Select the best-performing model based on business-relevant metrics
- Provide actionable business recommendations

---

##  Dataset Description
- Real-world bank marketing dataset
- Data collected through direct phone call campaigns
- Includes customer demographics, financial details, and campaign history
- Target variable: **Term Deposit Subscription (Yes / No)**

---

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed to:
- Analyze age distribution and subscription patterns
- Understand the impact of job type, loans, and previous campaigns
- Identify data imbalance and key trends influencing customer decisions

---

##  Model Building
The following machine learning models were implemented:
- Logistic Regression (baseline model)
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier

---

##  Model Evaluation
Models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score

Due to class imbalance, **Recall and F1-score** were prioritized.

---

##  Best Model Selection
**Random Forest** was selected as the final model because:
- It achieved the highest recall for identifying subscribers
- Provided a better balance between precision and recall
- Reduced overfitting compared to Decision Tree

---

##  Business Recommendations
- Target customers aged between 30–50
- Prioritize customers with successful past campaign outcomes
- Avoid excessive call frequency to reduce customer fatigue
- Use predictive modeling to optimize marketing costs

---

##  Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics and machine
learning workflow, combining technical modeling with business insights
to support smarter marketing decisions in the banking domain.
